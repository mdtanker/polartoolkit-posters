This repo contains some of the materials used during various presentations of the PolarToolkit (previously Antarctic-Plots) package at conferences.

The main notebook, which can be run online with the above Binder link, is [Poster_plots.ipynb](Poster_plots.ipynb).

See the [PolarToolkit website here](https://polartoolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
